# DATS 6401 Final-Project - Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis: Drivers, Trends, and Policy Recommendations
Data Visualization Final Project. CO2 Emissions Analysis.

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our era, and CO₂ emissions are the primary contributors to this global crisis. As nations strive to mitigate the impacts of climate change, understanding the underlying drivers of CO₂ emissions becomes essential.

## Motivation
One of our main climate goals is to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Reducing CO₂ emissions is crucial for achieving this goal. This project explores global emission trends, evaluates the influence of technological advancements, and examines the roles of specific countries and sectors in contributing to CO₂ emissions.

### Key Research Questions:
1. Which countries have contributed the most to global CO₂ emissions?
2. Which countries have the highest per capita CO₂ emissions annually, and why?
3. How do CO₂ emissions vary across income groups globally?
4. Is there any relationship between population and CO₂ emissions?
5. Which sector has the highest impact on CO₂ emissions?
6. How are the trends in CO₂ emissions from land-use change and forestry evolving over time?
7. What are the policy recommendations to reduce CO₂ emissions?

## Team Members and Contributions
- **Prudhvi Chekuri**: Country-level CO₂ emissions analysis, plots, and animations.
- **Satya Phanindra Kumar Kalaga**: Sectoral analysis of emissions, structuring, and visualization.
- **Deepika Reddygari**: Renewable energy analysis, policy recommendations, and report writing.

## Description of Data
The analysis is based on datasets sourced from Gapminder, Climate Watch, and IRENA:

1. **CO₂ Emissions by Country**: Total and per capita CO₂ emissions (Gapminder).
2. **Population by Country**: Historical and forecasted population data (Gapminder).
3. **Gross National Income (GNI) Per Capita**: Income levels for countries (Gapminder).
4. **CO₂ Emissions by Sector**: Sector-wise emissions data (Climate Watch).
5. **Renewable Energy Dataset**: Installed electricity capacity by technology (IRENA).

Key Features of the Data:
- **Temporal Coverage**: Data spans multiple decades.
- **Regional Segmentation**: Organized by country and region.
- **Sectoral Breakdown**: Detailed sector-wise emissions.

## Main Analysis

### Question 1: Which countries have contributed the most to global CO₂ emissions?

- **Historical CO₂ Emissions**: Emissions began increasing during the Industrial Revolution and grew exponentially post-1950s.
- **Top 7 Emitting Countries**:
  - **Findings**: The U.S. is the largest historical emitter, contributing almost 25% of total emissions. Recent years show China as the highest annual emitter.

### Question 2: Which countries have the highest per capita CO₂ emissions annually and why?

- **Choropleth Map**:
  - High per capita emissions in countries like Saudi Arabia and the U.S.
  - Low emissions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  - **Insights**: Income levels strongly influence emissions.

### Question 3: How do CO₂ emissions vary across income groups globally?

- **Bar Chart Analysis**:
  - High-income countries contribute over 80% of global emissions despite housing a smaller share of the global population.
  - Low-income countries, despite a 50% population share, contribute only 18%.

### Question 4: Is there any relationship between population and CO₂ emissions?

- **Scatter Plot**:
  - High-income countries dominate emissions relative to their population share.

### Question 5: Which sector has the highest impact on CO₂ emissions?

- **Sectoral Contribution**:
  - Energy: 76.3% of emissions.
  - Agriculture: 13.4%.
  - Industrial Processes, Waste, and Land-Use Change contribute smaller shares.

### Question 6: Trends in CO₂ Emissions from Land-Use Change and Forestry

- **Findings**:
  - Land-use change contributes negatively to emissions, reflecting afforestation efforts.

### Question 7: Policy Recommendations to Reduce CO₂ Emissions

1. **Expand Renewable Energy Adoption**:
   - Invest in solar, wind, and other renewables.
2. **Incentivize Renewable Energy Deployment**:
   - Provide subsidies and tax breaks.
3. **Promote R&D**:
   - Focus on emerging renewable technologies and energy storage.
4. **Support Energy Efficiency Measures**:
   - Implement energy audits and adopt efficient technologies.

## Key Findings
- The U.S. is the largest historical emitter, while China leads in recent annual emissions.
- High-income countries disproportionately contribute to global emissions.
- Energy is the dominant sector for emissions.
- Renewable energy technologies like solar and wind are rapidly growing.

## Conclusion
CO₂ emissions drive climate change, leading to rising temperatures, extreme weather, and biodiversity loss. Addressing emissions requires global collaboration, technological innovation, and equitable climate policies.

## Limitations
- Data gaps for certain regions and sectors.
- Focus limited to CO₂, excluding other greenhouse gases.

## Future Directions
- Expand analyses to include multiple greenhouse gases.
- Enhance regional and sectoral data granularity.
